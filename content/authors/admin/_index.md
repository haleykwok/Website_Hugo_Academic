Whole-person development is important, ensure you are living life both mentally and physically healthy :) The most important thing I value is being your unique self, love what you are working on and not [conforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity) to others blindly.

- Novels/Films: Sci-fi favorites include [The Three-Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)), [Interstellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)), and [Resident Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil), etc.
- Documentaries: Primarily about natural sciences, history, biography, etc.
- Exercise: Gym workouts and swimming
- Music: Piano and music genres like R&B, dreampop, darkpop, electropop, and hip-hop.
- Cooking: Chinese cuisine, desserts (bread and cake), and Western dishes.
- Gaming: I play FPS and TPS games such as [PUBG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayerUnknown%27s_Battlegrounds), [CSGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive), and action-adventure games like [Assassin's Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed) and [GTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto). I also enjoy improving my skills through online tutorials.
- Board Games: I enjoy playing board games like [Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan) and [Saboteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saboteur_(card_game)) with friends. Recently, I discovered an interesting game called [Publish or Perish: A Humorous Party Game about Academia](https://x.com/thepublishgame?lang=en). Can't wait to play it with my friends!

<summary>Click here to know more about My Story: Embrace CURIOSITY, Confront CHALLENGES, and Drive CHANGE</summary>

Ever since the second grade of elementary school, I have been exposed to computers, and my interest in this machine grew rapidly. I was first introduced to programming languages through a Java-based video game. The iconic blue coffee cup with a red steam still holds a vivid presence in my memory. This initial interaction with the computer sparked a CURIOSITY that prompted me to delve deeper into the world of technology and programming. During my high school years, due to gender stereotyping and attending a traditional all-girls school with a low participation rate of girls in science and technology, I was discouraged from choosing logic and math-based subjects by surrounding people, causing me to pass up the opportunity to study Physics and Information Technology. While I entered university, I rediscovered my passion for STEM and decided to embrace my love for technology. However, without any science-related subjects in my educational background, I was at a disadvantage when it came to choosing engineering subjects such as computer science and electronic engineering in university admission. Fortunately, with the support of my professors, I received the chances to participate in computer science related projects and took several computer science courses, which helped me to strengthen my computer science background. -->

<!-- The first programmer in the world is often credited to Ada Lovelace, who was indeed a woman -->

<!-- My CURIOSITY led me to explore the field of STEM and to participate in the RAIDS human-robot collaboration research project in my constant quest for new knowledge. While participating in competitions and winning honors, I cherish the pursuit of new knowledge and technology. Later, I worked as a research intern at McGill University in Canada, where I gained more research experience and knowledge in the field of computer science. These experiences mean a lot to me, and I am grateful for the opportunities that have been given. 

I like to accept CHALLENGES and face difficulties. In my research and innovation projects, I look forward to constantly challenging myself and finding innovative solutions to problems. I actively participate in international academic exchange programs and entrepreneurial competitions, and bravely face unknown challenges. This will enable me to break through and realize my potential.

I envision a future filled with the power of CHANGE, and I hope to transform my research results into real products and promote the development of the science and technology industry. My love for STEM and my personal story reinforce my belief in influencing more students and expanding the impact of science and technology. -->


<!-- With the support of Hong Kong Polytechnic University KTEO, the research result of human-robot collaboration project has led to the foundation of [CobotAI Limited](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/kteo/polyventures/impactful-startups/polyu-startups/mf/2022/cobot-ai-limited/) [(registered)](https://www.hkcorporationsearch.com/companies/3162071/). -->

<!-- Although my path to studying computer science is considered to be bumpy, I made no regret on the decision I made earlier because I believe every journey has its value in life. As Steve Jobs said, “You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” Many people take their majors too seriously since we always think that we are done after college, but we forget that learning is a lifelong process and society is a bigger classroom. If possible, go for an internship as early as possible to see how you fit into different industries. What to study is not the only important specialty, there are too many places in the university that you can learn the skills, via community services, a variety of competitions, and campus entrepreneurship, to name a few. Learners can find the direction of the future work through these activities, to let you shine in the future.

This era of knowledge iteration is too fast, the current design graduates do not know how they have learned so many years of graphic skills a midway two minutes to change via Midjourney, so always keep CURIOSITY, maintain the ability to quickly follow up on the iteration of the ability to always be learning, face with CHALLENGES, and make CHANGES to our community, you will not be anxious. Take things seriously, but not too serious :)

In the journey of my future development, the 3Cs - Curiosity, Challenges, and Changes - will guide my path. I firmly believe and being sanguine that by maintaining curiosity, embracing challenges, and dedicating myself to change, I will achieve the future I aspire to. With the power of the 3Cs, I will explore, grow, realize my dreams, and make an impact on society. We're here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise, why else even be here?
